# Unlocking The Flavor Network
This project is for the generation of novel flavor combinations based on shared flavor compounds between food ingredients.
Novel flavor combinations are combined with a matrix of existing recipes as a way to incorporate conventional ingredient combination.
Tfidf vectorization and Kmeans clustering was used to narrow down ingredient combination focus.

Data is from https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00196
          &  https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/
          
Tools: Numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, flask, chord

Use where novel flavor combination is called for, in a private or professional setting.
